"""
Create a reversible reaction of <(Ca(OH)2)> dehydration and <(CaO)> hydration.
During dehydratation process (heat storage), <(Ca(OH)2)> absorbs heat and decomposes to produce <(CaO)> and <(H2O)>.
In the exothermic process, <(CaO)> reacts with <(H2O)> to form <(Ca(OH)2)>, 
releasing stored chemical energy as heat.
